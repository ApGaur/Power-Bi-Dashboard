**Problem to Solve:**
The dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Super Mart's supply chain performance. It addresses the need to monitor and analyze key metrics related to order fulfillment, product performance, and regional variations in supply chain efficiency.
Tools and Technologies Used:
Based on the visual style and complexity of the dashboard, it appears to have been created using:

Microsoft Power BI - for data visualization and dashboard creation
My SQL - for data storage and retrieval
Excel - potentially for initial data preparation or as a data source

**Approach to Solving the Problem:**

 Collected data from various sources (orders, shipments, products, regional information).
 Established key performance indicators (KPIs) such as On-Time Delivery %, In-Full %, and OTIF%.
 Created multi-level views (overall, by product category, by city, by customer).
 Incorporated monthly trends for key metrics.
 Added filters for month, day, and week number to allow for detailed exploration.

**Insights Gained:**

Overall Performance: The dashboard shows an OTIF% (On-Time In-Full) of 52.78%, indicating significant room for improvement in order fulfillment.
Regional Variations: Performance metrics vary by city, with Ahmedabad showing better performance in some areas.
Product Category Performance: Milk appears to be the highest volume product, but also shows lower VOTF% compared to other categories.
Delivery Timing: There's a significant portion of orders (457.78K) not shipped, which requires investigation.
Customer Segmentation: The split by customers reveals varying performance across different store types.
Trend Analysis: Monthly trends show fluctuations in key metrics, allowing for identification of seasonal patterns or ongoing issues.
